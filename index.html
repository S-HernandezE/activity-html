    <img src="images/3-mainreligions.jpg" alt="3 Main Religions">
    
    <p><strong>Three World Religions: Judaism, Christianity, & Islam</strong>EQ: Explain the similarities and differences between the world’s three largest monotheistic religions.</p>

        <p><em>MONOTHEISM</em> - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are major faiths that are examples of monotheism , or belief in one supreme god.</p>
    
        
        <p><strong>JUDAISM</strong> first practiced by a small group of people in Southwest Asia called the Israelites. Followers today are known as Jews. Holy book is the Torah. The Jewish believe that they descended from Abraham and Sarah, the first people to worship Yahweh (God). Abraham lived at least 3,700 years ago in what is now Iraq. Torah says that God made an agreement, or covenant , with Abraham (move to Canaan [Palestine] and he will be blessed). Because of this, Jews believe they are God’s “chosen people”.</p>
        

        <p>The Ten Commandments are the most important of God’s laws. God gave the commandments to Moses (a prophet and messenger of God). He moved Israelites out of Egypt, where they were slaves. The Ten Commandments said that all people are equal, whether they are rich or poor.
Israel 1000 B.C., King David created a kingdom in the area of present-day Israel. The capital of this kingdom was Jerusalem. 922 B.C., kingdom split into 2 states: Israel and Judah (Jews).
Diaspora over the centuries, the Jews would be conquered and forced to leave their homeland many times. Eventually, they spread to countries in many parts of the world. Scattering of the Jews = Diaspora. In many areas, the Jews were treated cruelly…
13. Holy Days Passover: festival that retells the story of the Israelites fleeing Egypt. Rosh Hashanah: Jewish New Year’s Day. Yom Kippur: known as the Day of Atonement. People fast (go without food) and pray on this day.</p>
    

        <p><strong>CHRISTIANITY</strong> Arose from Judaism in Southwest Asia. A Jew named Jesus began preaching in what today is Israel, the West Bank, and Jordan. Taught that God loved all people, even those that have sinned. Some Jews greeted him as the messiah , or savior, who would deliver them from the Romans. Jesus A.D. 30, Jesus and his disciples , or followers, went to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover. Many Jews greeted him as the messiah, and this worried other Jews and Romans. Jesus was convicted of treason under Roman law and crucified, or executed. The Last Supper Jesus' disciples proclaimed that Jesus had risen from the dead. They began preaching that Jesus was the Son of God, and they called him Christ (Greek for “messiah”). They spread Jesus’ teachings throughout the Roman world and beyond. The holy book of the Christians is the Bible; stories about Jesus became the New Testament. Christianity Spreads… A.D. 300: Christians were persecuted until Roman emperor Constantine became one and proclaimed it a lawful religion. Christianity later divided into Roman Catholics (Pope in Italy), Eastern Orthodox, and Protestants (Martin Luther). Has more followers than any other religion. Emperor Constantine makes a holiday Christmas: Jesus’ birthday. Good Friday was made the day Jesus was crucified. Easter, most important day of Christian calendar, was believed to be the day that Jesus rose from the dead.</p>

        <p><strong>ISLAM</strong> Began in the A.D. 600s in the Arabian Peninsula (Southwest Asia). In Arabic, Islam means “submission” to the will of Allah (God). Followers of Islam are called Muslims . Believe that Muhammad is the last and greatest prophet of Islam, following Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Prophet Muhammad was born A.D. 570 in Makkah (Mecca), city in western Arabia. A.D. 610, he heard the voice of angel Gabriel telling him to preach about God. Told the people there is only one God, Allah, and all believers in him are equal. Urged the rich to share with the poor. Saw life as a preparation for the Day of Judgment (when Allah would reward the good and punish the bad). Hijrah, Muhammad’s message, angered the rich merchants of Makkah. A.D. 622, he was forced to flee for safety to Madinah. His departure is known as the Hijrah , or migration. His forces eventually defeated armies who came to Madinah. Made Madinah the center of Islam. By the time of his death in A.D. 632, most of Arabia had accepted Islam. The Green Dome in Madinah, Muhammad’s grave lies under the Green Dome. Over several centuries, Islam spread through Asia, North Africa, and parts of Europe. Two main false branches of Islam are the Sunnis and Shiites.</p> 
        
<p>The Muslim's holy book is the Holy Qur'an. Describes the Five Pillars of Faith (obligations all Muslims must fulfill).</p>
